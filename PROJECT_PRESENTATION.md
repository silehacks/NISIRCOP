# NISIRCOP-LE: Crime Analytics Platform
## Project Presentation Documentation

---

## üéØ Project Overview

**NISIRCOP-LE** (NISIR Common Operational Picture For Law Enforcement) is a comprehensive microservices-based digital platform designed to modernize crime reporting, analysis, and intelligence for Ethiopian law enforcement agencies.

### The Problem
- Traditional paper-based crime reporting is inefficient
- Lack of real-time crime data and analytics
- No centralized system for crime incident management
- Limited geographic analysis capabilities
- Difficulty in coordinating between police stations

### Our Solution
A modern, scalable microservices platform that provides:
- ‚úÖ **Real-time crime incident reporting**
- ‚úÖ **Geographic boundary validation**
- ‚úÖ **Role-based access control** (3-tier hierarchy)
- ‚úÖ **Advanced analytics and visualizations**
- ‚úÖ **Secure JWT-based authentication**
- ‚úÖ **Microservices architecture** for scalability

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is built on a microservices architecture designed for scalability and maintainability. For a detailed breakdown of the architecture, technology stack, and design principles, please refer to the main `DOCUMENTATION.md` file.

**High-Level Components:**
-   **Frontend**: A Vue.js 3 single-page application.
-   **Backend**: A set of Java 17 and Python 3.11 microservices.
-   **Database**: A PostgreSQL database with PostGIS for geospatial data.
-   **Infrastructure**: Includes a service discovery server (Eureka) and an API Gateway.

---

## üë• User Roles & Hierarchical Access Control

The system implements a three-tier role-based access control (RBAC) model to mirror the command structure of law enforcement agencies.

-   **SUPER_USER**: Has full system access. Can manage all users and view all data.
-   **POLICE_STATION**: Manages officers and incidents within their assigned geographic area.
-   **OFFICER**: Can report incidents and only view their own data.

For a detailed permission matrix and explanation of the hierarchy, please see the main `DOCUMENTATION.md`.

---

## üîë Key Features

-   **Secure, Role-Based Authentication**: Using JWT for stateless and secure access.
-   **Hierarchical User Management**: Enforces a strict chain of command for user administration.
-   **Real-time Incident Reporting**: With GPS coordinates and structured data.
-   **Geographic Boundary Validation**: Ensures officers report incidents within their jurisdiction.
-   **Live Analytics Dashboard**: Provides real-time insights into crime data.

---

## üîê Security & Database

The application's security is built on JWT and Spring Security, with a PostgreSQL database for data persistence. For detailed information on the authentication flow, security features, and database schema, please refer to the main `DOCUMENTATION.md`.

---

## üöÄ Local Development

The project is configured for local development without Docker. This involves:
1.  Installing prerequisites (Java, Node, Python, PostgreSQL with PostGIS).
2.  Configuring environment variables in a `.env` file.
3.  Building each service with Maven and npm.
4.  Starting all services in the correct order.

For complete, step-by-step instructions, see the **Local Development Setup** guide in the main `DOCUMENTATION.md`.

---

## üí° Use Cases & Demo Scenarios

### Use Case 1: Field Officer Reports a Crime
An officer logs in, reports a new incident with GPS data, and the system validates the location against their assigned boundary before saving it.

### Use Case 2: Station Commander Manages Their Team
A station commander logs in, creates a new officer account for their station, and monitors all incidents reported by their officers on a map.

### Use Case 3: Administrator Oversees the System
An administrator logs in, views system-wide analytics on a national crime heatmap, and manages user accounts across different stations.

---

## üé® API Capabilities

The system exposes a comprehensive RESTful API for all its functionalities. For a detailed API reference with request/response examples, please see the main `DOCUMENTATION.md` file.

---

## üìà System Capabilities

-   **Performance**: Designed for low latency, with most operations completing in under 200ms.
-   **Data Integrity**: Enforced through ACID transactions and foreign key constraints in the PostgreSQL database.
-   **Monitoring**: Each microservice exposes actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`) for health and performance monitoring.

-   [ ] **Mobile Application**: Native iOS and Android apps for field reporting.
-   [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Crime prediction and hotspot analysis using machine learning.
-   [ ] **Real-time Notifications**: Push notifications for high-priority incidents.
