# ðŸš¨ Security Best Practices
# Change Default Passwords: The default user accounts are for demonstration purposes only. You must change the passwords for all default users immediately upon first login in a production setting.
# Secure JWT Secret: The JWT_SECRET in your .env file must be a long, random, and cryptographically strong string. Do not use the default or a simple, guessable value.
# Network Security: In a production environment, expose only the necessary ports (e.g., 80/443 for the frontend and API gateway) to the public internet. Use a firewall to restrict access to internal service ports like the database or discovery server.
# Do Not Commit .env: Ensure that your .env file is listed in your .gitignore file and is never committed to version control.
